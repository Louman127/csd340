                    Weight Lifting
                </div>

                
                <div class="card-content">

                    I really enjoy weightlifting. It is something that I have done
                    since I was a kid. I enjoy exercise in general; however, I am
                    always inclined to lift weghts over anything else. When I was about
                    19 I fractured both of my wrists and couldn't lift for quite some time.
                    I am glad to be lifting Weights again after a rough batlle with an illness
                    of mine. It is a hobby I am grateful for.

                    I know that gaming is somehting that is common in the software development world;
                    however, it is a hobby that I have enjoyed doing since I was a kid. I remember satying up
                    nights during the summer playing role playing games. When I got older my friends and I would
                    stay up late playing video games and interchanging with lifting weights. I don't have much
                    time for video games nowadays but it is a hobby that I enhjoy.

                    As someone who is double majoring in Cyber Security and Software development
                    I can say that both are extremly fun but coding is much more fun! I truly enjoy coding.
                    I enjoy being able to use computer coding lanugages to be able to create programs and 
                    applications from the ground up.
